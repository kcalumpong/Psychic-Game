    <!-- 1. Computer chooses a secret random value between a-z.
    2. User tries to guess what that letter is by pressing it on the keyboard.
    3. We decide if the user wins or not.
        *If the user guesses before they run out of guesses, they win.
        *If the user doesn't guess before they run out, they lose.
    4. We add to their score. 
        *If user wins then we add to their wins.
        *If user loses then we add to their losses.
        *We keep track of the users guess in 'Guesses so far'. 
    5. Game resets to 0 after a win or a loss.     -->

<!-- <h1>The Psychic Game</h1> -->

<p>Guess what letter I am thinking of!<p>

<p>Wins: 0</p>
<p>Losses: 0</p>
<!-- <p>Guesses Left:</p>
<p>Your Guesses so far:</p> -->

<!-- 
4. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

5. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

6. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

7. Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

8. When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

9. When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
