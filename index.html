    <!-- 
    1. Computer chooses a secret random value between a-z. Will use math random, math floor.
    
    2. User tries to guess what that letter is by pressing it on the keyboard. Will log this with an onkey event.
    
    3. We decide if the user wins or not.
        *If the user guesses before they run out of guesses, they win.
        *If the user doesn't guess before they run out, they lose.
    
        4. We add to their score. Using content.text to update the static HTML. 
        *If user wins then we add to their wins by using an "if" condition.
        *If user loses then we add to their losses by using an "if" condition.
        *We keep track of the users guess and score by using text.Content.
    
        5. Game resets to 0 and clears guesses after a win or a loss. By calling a function we created.    -->
